# Simple Calculator Programs in C and C++

This repository contains two basic calculator programs written in **C** and **C++**. These are my first programs, designed to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each program allows the user to input two numbers and an operator to get the result.

## Programs Overview

### 1. Simple Calculator in C
- Written in **C**.
- Takes two numbers as input along with an operator (+, -, *, /).
- Performs the corresponding operation and displays the result.
- Handles division by zero errors.

### 2. Simple Calculator in C++
- Written in **C++**.
- Performs the same functionality as the C version.
- Uses a similar approach to take input and output results.
- Also checks for division by zero.

## How to Run the Programs

### For C Program:
1. Install a C compiler (like GCC).
2. Save the C code in a file named `calculator.c`.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc calculator.c -o calculator
Run the program:

```bash
./calculator
```
For C++ Program:
Install a C++ compiler (like g++).

Save the C++ code in a file named calculator.cpp.

Open a terminal/command prompt and compile the program:
``` bash
g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
```
Run the program:
```bash
./calculator
```
My First Programming Steps
These are my first attempts at writing programs in C and C++. Through these, I learned the basics of user input, output, and simple condition handling in both languages. The programs are simple but were an important first step in learning the syntax and structure of these programming languages.
